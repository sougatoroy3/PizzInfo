### Downloading all the playgrounds

Unless otherwise indicated, all playgrounds are compatible with Swift 3 and later.
Swift 3+ Playground

# Steps to Run
Clone the folder and run it from the swift playgrounds app.
You may even use XCode or VSCode to run it.

*Note you'll need the swift toolchain and compiler to run it on a windows machine*

# Disclaimer
This is just a preview of the complete app. I'm still working on it. Your ideas and suggestions are always welcome.
